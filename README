MiBench RISC-V
--------------

This is a modified version of MiBench 1.0 downloaded from https://vhosts.eecs.umich.edu/mibench/.

Benchmarks that currently compile and run for RV64 using spike (with the risc-v pk) are:

    - automotive/basicmath
    - automotive/bitcount
    - automotive/qsort
    - network/dijkstra
    - network/patricia

The output of these benchmarks has not been verified against the expected results provided with the original MiBench code.
